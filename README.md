Simple program for creating Beat Saber playlists based on your and your friends' (or foes'?) scores.


Look up your Scoresaber ID, put it in the SSID field and hit OK.

Hit Update Scores to populate a local file for your scores. (This also populates the dropdown for quicker access in the future, so you don't have to input the SSID each time.)

Do the same for the person you want to bop.

Specify a star range and the number of entries that your playlist should have.

Specify whether you want to include maps that you don't have a score on, but the other person does.
